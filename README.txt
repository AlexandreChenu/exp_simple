simple_ebn.cpp is a SFERES2 experience. It uses NN2 module to train a Neural Network in order to allow a robot arm to autonomously learn a controller to reach a fix target. 

Neural Network :
Inputs : - distance between the gripper and the target (x-axis)
         - distance between the gripper and the target (y-axis)
         
Outputs : - first motor input 
          - second motor input 
          - third motor input 

Algorithm's pipeline :
1. Creation of all the template types in order to create a QD algorithm
2. Algorithm running 
3. Results collection

Dependencies :
The algorithm depends on :
- NN2 module, in order to install it, please refer to Usage & installation section in the module's 
github page https://github.com/sferes2/nn2.
- fit_behav.hpp, a file describing both QD algorithm's parameters and evaluation function.

If you want to save the best model after each dump period, please uncomment line 137 and comment line 138 in order to 
change the stats. The aglorithm will then depend on:
- best_fit_nn.hpp, a modified version of SFERES2's best_fit.hpp implementation. best_fit_nn.hpp 
refers to absolute path, you will have to manually change it. 
TODO: change absolute path to relative path

How to launch it :
- Install and modify all necessary dependences
- Compile the experience with ./waf --exp simple_ex
- Launch it with ./<path-to-executable>/simple_ebn

Nota for AIRL project members: the Docker image available via the ac_env's Dockerfile  (https://gitlab.doc.ic.ac.uk/AIRL/airl_env/tree/ac/ac_env) allow you to launch the code without any additional installation.
